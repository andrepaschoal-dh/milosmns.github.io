## To my visitors…

I write here about software, tech and tech organizations. _(for the most part)_

#### Why though?

I like sharing ideas through presentations and writing.

If you see anything tech-related, I'll probably like it.
I’m a software enthusiast, product developer, engineering lead, tech speaker, event organizer, passionate skier.

My main interests are Mobile, Cloud, electronics and Smart Devices.
Other than that, I'll read often about innovation, computer science and organization.

In my spare time I (try to) travel, speak at conferences, coach, and work on open-source stuff.
