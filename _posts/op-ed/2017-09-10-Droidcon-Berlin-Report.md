If youâ€™ve been following my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/milosmns), you'll have seen my posts from [Droidcon Berlin](droidcon.de) this year. This is a summary of that visit.

##### Where and how

Droidcon was hosted at CityCube in the outskirts of Berlin's ring area, in a conference building within the Messe Berlin (something like a city Fair). _Fun fact_: Messe Berlin also hosted the [IFA show](http://ifa-berlin.com) there, at the same time as Droidcon, so we got free tickets for IFA too! Wouhouu!

There were a lot of different talks, ranging from core Android, IoT, Privacy, to Legal, Marketing and other. All of them were interesting to a different type of audience.

### Highlights

*Notes about Coroutines*

Svetlanaâ€™s [talk about Kotlin Coroutines](http://droidcon.de/en/sessions/kotlin-coroutines) included a lot of information about the new threading concept in Kotlin and explained a lot of languageâ€™s advances in comparison to the last yearâ€™s Kotlin release.

Another interesting talk was about [Marketing for developers](http://droidcon.de/en/sessions/marketing-developers-get-your-app-users-hands) where Sylwester explained how to get more engagements and have a wider reach within the Android user community. Super insightful.

We also took quite a few breaks in the GDG lounge, where we always felt welcome. ðŸ˜¬

Danny **live-coded** a couple of great examples of how Kotlin can be used to make your life as a developer easier. Find more information about that in [his talk here](http://droidcon.de/en/sessions/power-kotlin-your-tests).

We also saw a double rainbow on the second day! ðŸ˜¬

![Unit Test Tips](/images/posts/droidcon-unit-tests.jpeg)
*Unit test tips*
{: refdef}

Paulina and Grzegorz showed us [how to write Unit tests using Kotlin](http://droidcon.de/en/sessions/kotlinify-your-unit-tests-and-specs). Fun fact: Kotlin is also a brand of ketchup in Poland!

![Samsung Hall](/images/posts/droidcon-samsung.jpeg)
*Samsung's showcase*
{: refdef}

While on the IFA show, we took a stroll through Samsungâ€™s "Infinity Hall" where you could have your face digitalized using Samsung's latest tech. We also touched the famous Galaxy Note 8 for the first time! Lost of fun (and free food) during the IFA show! ðŸ˜¬

Last, but not least, [Ralfâ€™s talk about scheduling jobs](http://droidcon.de/en/sessions/doo-z-z-z-z-z-e) was the one that I liked the most, so hereâ€™s a photo from that talk showing the jobs libraryâ€™s API.

*Job Scheduling API*
{: refdef}

The API is so clean and easy to use, it will surely become my go-to job scheduling library in the near future. I might also integrate it into [Silly Android](https://github.com/milosmns/silly-android), who knows?!

##### Closure

I didn't want the conference to end, but all good things come to an end... but you can get more of the Droidcon atmosphere from their social accounts. All in all, it was super fun.

Droidcon, I'll see you next year!
