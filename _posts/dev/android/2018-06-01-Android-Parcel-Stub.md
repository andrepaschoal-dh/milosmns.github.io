Did you ever wonder how to test any `Parcelable` data? Like a class implemented from the `Parcelable` interface, some kind of state class, or maybe something needs to be Parcelable inside of your custom Android Views... well, you would probably skip the testing altogether, right? Itâ€™s almost impossible to mock it properly and the implementation is simple enough not to make any errors anyway, right? Right?

Not a good idea. If you **add or edit** fields in your Parcelable's implementation class, itâ€™s easy to forget to update the Parcelable implementation in all (3?) places. Reading about this issue, I found some bare-bones solutions, for example [this one](https://gist.github.com/Sloy/d59a36e6c51214d0b131)... but I eventually came up with a simple but more complete solution for this problem.

### My version

```kotlin
// Mockito is required for this to work
class ParcelFake {

  companion object {
    @JvmStatic fun obtain(): Parcel {
      return ParcelFake().mock
    }
  }

  private var position = 0
  private var store = mutableListOf<Any>()
  private var mock = mock<Parcel>()

  init {
    setupWrites()
    setupReads()
    setupOthers()
  }

  // uncomment when needed for the first time
  private fun setupWrites() {
    val answer = { i: InvocationOnMock ->
      with(store) {
        add(i.arguments[0])
        get(lastIndex)
      }
    }
    whenever(mock.writeByte(anyByte())).thenAnswer(answer)
    whenever(mock.writeInt(anyInt())).thenAnswer(answer)
    whenever(mock.writeString(anyString())).thenAnswer(answer)
    // whenever(mock.writeLong(anyLong())).thenAnswer(answer)
    // whenever(mock.writeFloat(anyFloat())).thenAnswer(answer)
    // whenever(mock.writeDouble(anyDouble())).thenAnswer(answer)
  }

  // uncomment when needed for the first time
  private fun setupReads() {
    val answer = { _: InvocationOnMock -> store[position++] }
    whenever(mock.readByte()).thenAnswer(answer)
    whenever(mock.readInt()).thenAnswer(answer)
    whenever(mock.readString()).thenAnswer(answer)
    // whenever(mock.readLong()).thenAnswer(answer)
    // whenever(mock.readFloat()).thenAnswer(answer)
    // whenever(mock.readDouble()).thenAnswer(answer)
  }

  private fun setupOthers() {
    val answer = { i: InvocationOnMock ->
      position = i.arguments[0] as Int
      null
    }
    whenever(mock.setDataPosition(anyInt()))
      .thenAnswer(answer)
  }
}
```

You would use it just like a normal Parcel -- get an instance by calling the static `obtain()` method on that class, write and read using the Parcel's well-known class methods.

Happy stubbing! ðŸ˜¬
