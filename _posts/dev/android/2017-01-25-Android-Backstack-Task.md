### Inspiration

If you ever created an app that has more than 2 activities, itâ€™s likely that you needed to change the [launch mode](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#lmode) for some of them. I must admit that the whole thing is still a bit confusing to me...  Normally, I need to visualize everything in order to fully understand what happens -- that's what I was going to do with the screen navigation back stack too. There was a lot of information online already (also a lot of useless stuff, heh) but eventually I decided to create a simple app to demonstrate how activity stacking actually works and what happens inside.

### Experiment setup

The app binary can be [found here](https://github.com/milosmns/android-task-stack-example/releases/tag/v1.2), and the source [is here](https://github.com/milosmns/android-task-stack-example). I wrote it in Kotlin, but youâ€™ll get the idea of how things work even if you donâ€™t have any experience with Kotlin.

On to the main point.

The app shows the activity title on top of each screen, describing what kind of activity youâ€™re currently looking at. It also displays that activityâ€™s Intent origin (where it was started from). Next to it, each screen also shows the current activityâ€™s task ID, and the corresponding task ID from the origin activity.

Below all of that, thereâ€™s a list of currently active tasks from the OS -- or, at least the tasks we could access using the new API) -- so that you can see exactly what happens when you switch to another activity. You should only be interested in the launcher task and your appâ€™s tasks and ignore the other ones.

To change/switch/go to another type of activity, just use one of the buttons at the bottom, options are: `default`, `singleTop`, `singleTask`, `singleInstance`. You can read more about the tasks and back stack from the [official docs](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/tasks-and-back-stack.html), or take a look at this [explanation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvIlVsXxXmY) presented by Google's team.

### Results

To illustrate what I detected during this task and backstack experiment, I created a video using the app mentioned above and going through various scenarios, recording all of that and then wasting a few hours on preparing the output. **Warning**: there's some irritating background music I couldn't get rid of. ðŸ˜¬
