#### Inspiration

If youâ€™re supporting Android Nougat (OS 7.0-7.1, SDK 24-25), you probably know that one of the biggest changes introduced is the support for [multi-window user experience](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/multi-window.html). Most of the apps are now allowing users to get into the new, minimized viewing mode. But, youâ€™re probably also [having issues](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/android-7.0-nougat%20multi-window%20android?mode=all) while preparing apps for the split-screen view... I sure am... so, I wanted to create a demo app to share an example of how Android chooses which layout to render.

#### Structure

My idea is to create an app that would display the current configuration on the screen. It will show the following information:

  1. Activity orientation
  1. Device orientation
  1. Activity mode (full-screen vs. split-screen)
  1. Mode change origin (what triggered the configuration change)

Stock Android Nougat offers 3 split-screen configurations while in portrait mode: `1:2`, `1:1`, and `2:1`. While in landscape mode, there is only one split-screen configuration: `1:1`.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Portrait 1-1](/images/posts/split-port-1-1.png)
*Portrait mode / 1:1*
{: refdef}

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Portrait 2-1](/images/posts/split-port-2-1.png)
*Portrait mode / 2:1*
{: refdef}

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Portrait 1-2](/images/posts/split-port-1-2.png)
*Portrait mode / 1:2*
{: refdef}

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Landscape 1-1](/images/posts/split-land-1-1.png)
*Landscape mode / 1:1*
{: refdef}

**Note** -- Samsung devices offer finer control over the split ratio, which I personally find completely useless, and that behavior introduces some issues with detecting the configuration, of course... more on Samsung a bit later.

#### Under the hood

This app will detect the current activity's split-screen configuration. By looking at the app, weâ€™ll know which layout was be loaded by the OS. Moving between stock Android's split-screen configurations will always trigger an Activityâ€™s recreation cycle: `pause` â†’ `stop` â†’ `destroy` â†’ `create` â†’ `start` â†’ `resume`. So, yes, the **full cycle**. 

I'll also be using a library Iâ€™ve been working on ([SillyAndroid](https://github.com/milosmns/silly-android#silly-android)). If you check out the source code, youâ€™ll see that there is nothing special about these checks and you can do them manually if you prefer to. It's just resources in resource folders and switch/case/when clauses in bytecode.

To be able to see which mode and configuration our Activity is currently in, weâ€™ll need an empty layout with a TextView in the center of the Activity. This View is going to be updated each time something triggers a mode change.

###### The fun part

We need to find the current Activityâ€™s orientation, but also find the whole deviceâ€™s orientation (assuming there is only one screen).

```kotlin
val orientations = ... // magic, trust me, see the source later
val activityOrientation = orientations(this)
val deviceOrientation = orientations(applicationContext)
```

The trick here is to use the **Application** Context to detect the current screenâ€™s orientation, and use the **Activity** Context to detect the current Activityâ€™s orientation. This comes in handy especially when in split-screen mode.

Let's use the backward compatible check for multi-window and convert the result into a String for displaying it cleanly.

```kotlin
val isMultiWindowMode = SillyAndroid.UI.isInMultiWindowMode(this)
val screenMode = if (isMultiWindowMode)
  "split-screen" else "full-screen"
```

When you have this data ready, just populate the TextView:

```kotlin
textView.text = "Activity is now in $screenMode mode,\n" +
  "$activityOrientation.\n" +
  "Device is in $deviceOrientation.\n"
```

To be sure that the description was really changed, weâ€™ll also recolor the visible views to some random colors. Both `Coloring` and `getContentView()` come also from my Silly Android library.

See the coloring code:

```kotlin
val backgroundColor = ... // magic, trust me, see the source later
getContentView<ViewGroup>().setBackgroundColor(backgroundColor)
textView.setTextColor(Coloring.contrastColor(backgroundColor))
```

Now, if we put all of that into a single function, we can call the function from the Activityâ€™s `onCreate()` callback, and check the results in the UI.

### Samsung...

As you may know by now, Samsung always has their own way of doing things... and split-screen is not an exception. Apart from offering all of the mentioned ratios by default, they also offer a slider to make the apps split anywhere across the screen. It seems useful, right? It's not, and it's not worth the headache that comes with such a feature.

The feature, of course, causes new issues. Dragging and releasing the slider **anywhere else but** on `1:1`, `1:2` or `2:1` ratios **will not cause the activity to be recreated**.

How can we detect any changes, given that the Activity is not recreated?

Well, there's a workaround. You need to track the Configuration changes manually. There is no need to add anything in the `AndroidManifest` for this tracking, just override the `onConfigurationChanged()` callback on the Activity. To detect if split-screen ratio and window size has changed, you need to look for a `screenSize` changed flag. This also means that you need to save the last configuration somehow...

The code snippet is below.

```kotlin
override fun onConfigurationChanged(config: Configuration?) {
  super.onConfigurationChanged(config)
  config?.let {
    val interestingFlag = ActivityInfo.CONFIG_SCREEN_SIZE
    if (it.diff(savedOldConfig) and interestingFlag != 0) {
      savedOldConfig = Configuration(config)
      updateDescription()
    }
  }
}
```

### Closing words

After analyzing the results from the demo app, I found the following.

##### Activity is in the smaller window, ratio 1:2

  * Activity orientation is `landscape`
  * Screen/device orientation is `portrait`

##### Activity is in the half-screen window, portrait, ratio 1:1

  * Activity orientation is `landscape` (**!**)
  * Screen/device orientation is `portrait`

##### Activity is in the bigger window, ratio 2:1

  * Activity orientation is `portrait`
  * Screen/device orientation is `portrait`

##### Activity is in the half-screen window, landscape, ratio 1:1

  * Activity orientation is `portrait` (**!**)
  * Screen/device orientation is `landscape`
