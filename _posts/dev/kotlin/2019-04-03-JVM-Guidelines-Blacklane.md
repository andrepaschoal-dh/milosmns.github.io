Keeping it short (and sweet?); I have a freebie to share!

It's something that we compiled over time and it might be valuable for new JVM developers or future contributors to our products at [Blacklane](https://blacklane.com).

We're publishing our [JVM source code guidelines](https://github.com/blacklane/jvm-source-guidelines).

This document contains various resources on how to write clean, concise and readable code in Java and Kotlin, compliant with our internal rules and checks at Blacklane.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜¬
