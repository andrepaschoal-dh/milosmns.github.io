Thanks, Justin! But seriously, that pretty much sums it up.

I published a Circular Slider for Android. It's a simple View, it goes around in a circle, and you can color it using your own custom colors.

The usage is straightforward:

```xml
<me.angrybyte.circularslider.CircularSlider
  app:angle="3.14"
  app:border_color="#505090"
  app:border_thickness="14dp"
  app:border_gradient_colors="#f05151;#4a90e2;#4a90e2"
  app:thumb_color="#30AEFF"
  app:thumb_size="24dp" />
```

Many thanks to [@bistabil](https://github.com/bistabil) for working on this one and credit to [@staacopy](https://dribbble.com/staacopy) for the graphics.
