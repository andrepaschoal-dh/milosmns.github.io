_Note: This was tested on 12.04, but should work for later versions as well._

This installation is super simple. First of all (just in case) update your system -- you can find the steps about it on the site here.

When this is done, type in the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php5
```

That’s it. You should be able to use PHP 5 now.

_Note: For other versions, obviously just swap the number `5` with the required version number._
