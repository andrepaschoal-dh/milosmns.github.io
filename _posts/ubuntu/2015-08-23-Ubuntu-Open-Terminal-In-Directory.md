_Note: This was tested on 12.04, but should work for later versions as well._

The easiest way to open a Terminal in the current window path is to install a special Nautilus (default file manager) plugin. To do this, go to **Ubuntu Software Center** from the Lens menu, find the search field in the upper right corner of that window. Type:

```
nautilus-open-terminal
```

Install the plugin from the results. After installation, you may need to restart your machine or log in again... or just restart `nautilus` from the Terminal (advanced).

When the plugin is installed, go to any directory and right click on the empty space in its window -- so, not on a folder icon, not on any of the other icons or text. 

You should have an additional option now: `Open Terminal here`.
