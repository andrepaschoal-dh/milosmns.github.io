_Note: This was tested on 12.04, but should work for later versions as well._

You can use your normal copy/paste shortcuts in Terminal by simply adding the Shift button to the combinations.

#### Normal

- Copy: **Ctrl + C**
- Paste: **Ctrl + V**

#### Terminal

- Copy: **Ctrl + Shift + C**
- Paste: **Ctrl + Shift + V**

On a Mac use the Command button instead of Ctrl.
